# My Personal Project

## Description

**What will the application do?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make an application to track my
stats for a game I am playing right now called Brawl Stars. I've always
wanted to see what my win rate is and my k/d (kill death ratio) in the game
and whether I've improved or not over time.

Things I will add:
- Kill death ratio
- Playtime (estimate)
- Individual character statistics
- Overall trophy gain or over a particular time interval 
- Average damage per match
- Coin gain from drops (potentially)

**Who will use it?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would honestly use this to track my gameplay but
I know that my friends would also be interested in this application.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just wanted to make something that is actually useful for me
to use daily. Monitoring the games I've participated in could not only provide insights 
into my gameplay tactics but also facilitate my improvement as a player.
I also think I would enjoy making something like this because then it won't 
feel like school work but rather a hobby.
