# My Personal Project

## Description

**What will the application do?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to design a game where you spawn in as a character 
that is surrounded by waves of monsters that chase 
after you. The character should be able to attack the enemies and
the weapon could be upgraded by collecting currencies 
player obtain in game, and it should save the progress even 
if player exist the application. 

**Who will use it?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person that is interested could play this game. It 
will be pretty rudimentary and easy to get started.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've actually made a similar game for my capstone project in high school,
but I kind of just followed a tutorial and the game was extremely poorly 
made. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to realize my ideas because of my limited 
knowledge in any coding language. For instance, I was not able to add:
- Enemy movement (it moved randomly)
- Items
- Attacking wasn't implemented correctly
- Ui was terrible

I want to see how much better I
could make the game would be with the knowledge of CPSC 110 and 210. 
To be clear, it won't be the same game and I intend to make 
a better game with new features starting from scratch. I also 
think I would enjoy making an actual game I could play because then 
I'll be motivated to work on it.
